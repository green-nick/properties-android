# Android extensions for [Properties](https://github.com/green-nick/properties)
Small, lightweight library that allows binding Android views and dialogs to Properties.
Main purpose is binding `Views` to `ViewModels` in MVVM patterns.

## Structure:
There is main project called `binds` and extensions: `bindsx` and `livedata`
which supports androidx views, Jetpack Lifecycle bindings and Livedata fields.

## `bindsx` Module
I would recommend you to take `bindsx` module If you use AppCompat/Jetpack components in your application.  
It is more convenient to use because of main advantage - automatic lifecycle handling.

### View binding:
```
class LoginViewModel {
    val email = propertyOf("")
    val emailEnabled = propertyOf(true)
    val password = propertyOf("")
    ...
}

class LoginActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    val vm: LoginViewModel = ...

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        ...
        val emailField: EditText = findViewById(R.id.email)

        bindEnabled(emailField, vm.emailEnabled)
        bindTextBidirectionally(emailField, vm.email)

        //or even by View's id only!
        bindTextBidirectionally(R.id.password, password)
    }
}
```
There are few differences between these bindings and from `binds` module:
1. Automatic subscription handling.
2. Ability to pass only View's id instead of View.
3. Fragments support.
4. Support of Snackbar and TextInputLayout bindings from Material library.

**Pay attention**  
If you want to use binding by View's id - it will throw exception if
View with given id won't be found in Activity/Fragment or it has inappropriate type.

### Lifecycle handling

All bindings from this module that receives Views as parameters are extensions of `LifecycleOwner`.  
Therefore, they "know" when unsubscribe. By default this will be happened on `ON_DESTROY` event\*.  
But you can override this behaviour by passing desired event into `bind...` method:
```
bindEnabled(emailField, vm.emailEnabled, Lifecycle.Event.ON_STOP)
```
In this case, subscription will be cancelled when `ON_STOP` event happens.

\* -  If given `LifecycleOwner` is Fragment, binding will use it's `viewLifecycleOwner` instead of Fragment itself.  
That's because Fragment's lifecycle is wider, than lifecycle of it's Views.  
If by some reason you need to use Fragment as actual LifecycleOwner, please use `asLifecycleOwner()` extension:
```
class LoginFragment: Fragment() {

    override fun onViewCreated(view: View, savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        val emailField: EditText = view.findViewById(R.id.email)

        asLifecycleOwner().bindEnabled(emailField, vm.emailEnabled)
    }
}
```
Bindings that receives View's id are extensions of ComponentActivity/Fragment,
so they are also able to handle lifecycle itself.

Besides that, if you want to use bindings from `binds` module,
you can simplify lifecycle handling by using these extensions of Subscription object:
```
toEvent(LifecycleOwner, Lifecycle.Event)

toPause(LifecycleOwner)

toStop(LifecycleOwner)

toDestroy(LifecycleOwner)
```
For example:
```
class LoginActivity : Activity() {
    val vm: LoginViewModel = ...

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        ...
        val emailField: EditText = findViewById(R.id.email)

        emailField.bindEnabled(vm.emailEnabled).toDestroy(this)
        emailField.bindTextBidirectionally(vm.email).toEvent(this, Lifecycle.Event.ON_PAUSE)
    }
}
```
These bindings will unsubscribe automatically, when given event happens.

### Additions
There are few additions in this module that could be useful:

1. `bind`, `bindNonNull`, `bindOnTrue`, `bindOnFalse` - similar to generic extensions from `Property` library, but lifecycle-aware.
2. `onclick` and `onLongClick` - the same as below in `binds` module but for Fragments.
3. `textChanged` - the same as below in `binds` module but for Fragments.
4. `actionListener` - the same as below in `binds` module but for Fragments.

## `binds` Module
If you don't want to use AppCompat or cannot by some reason, you always can use this module for binding.  
But it requires you a little bit more attention for handling lifecycle properly.
### View binding:
```
class LoginViewModel {
    val email = propertyOf("")
    val emailEnabled = propertyOf(true)
    ...
}

class LoginActivity : Activity() {
    val vm: LoginViewModel = ...

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        ...
        val emailField: EditText = findViewById(R.id.email)

        emailField.bindEnabled(vm.emailEnabled)
        emailField.bindTextBidirectionally(vm.email)
    }
}
```
After these bindings, our email EditText will respond on changes of `email` and `emailEnabled` properties.  
`bindTextBidirectionally` is two-way binding, so it will change View's attribute and will be changed itself  
when User enter the text to field.

### Lifecycle handling

Every bind method from `binds` module returns `Subscription` object which you have to keep
and call `unsubscribe()` when you don't want to receive updates
or keep reference to bound views.

For example in case when Activity is recreating after rotation
but your ViewModel with properties has been kept.  
To prevent memory leaks use that Subscriptions to unsubscribe in `onDestroy` (just for example) method:
```
class LoginActivity : Activity() {
    val vm: LoginViewModel = ...
    var subscription: Subscription? = null

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        ...
        val emailField: TextView = findViewById(R.id.user_email)

        subscription = emailField.bindTextBidirectionally(vm.email)
    }

    override fun onDestroy() {
        subscription?.unsubscribe() // this will prevent from memory leaks
        super.onDestroy()
    }
}
```
But keeping every separate subscription is uncomfortably.
So better to use `CompositeSubscriptions` for keeping many subscriptions and unsubscribe from them at once:
```
val subscriptions = CompositeSubscription()

subscriptions += bindVisibility(...)
subscriptions += bindText(...)
subscriptions += bindEnabled(...)

subscriptions.unsubscribe() // unsubscribe all added subscriptions
```

### Additions
There are few additions in this module that could be useful:

1. `debouncePropertyOf` based on Handler with Main Looper (Handler could be changed).
2. `postSet` extension function of MutableProperty that will set given value on UI Thread only, no matter where has it been called.
3. `on–°lick` and `onLongClick` extensions of View and Activity. Allows you to set lambda-callbacks without View parameter. Version for Activity allows to pass only View's id instead of View itself.
4. `BoundAdapter` - for nicer binding any Adapter to Property which contains List of items.
5. `textChanged` extension of TextView and Activity. Simpler analog of TextWatcher::onTextChanged. Version for Activity allows to pass only TextView's id instead of View itself.
6. `actionListener` extension of TextView and Activity. Simpler analog of OnEditorActionListener. Version for Activity allows to pass only TextView's id instead of View itself.

## Extension
This library provides only very basic bindings for the most common Views out of the box.  
As it doesn't use code generation, you have to add missing bindings by yourself.  
This could be done only in few lines of code.  
Anyway, If you believe that some binding should be in the library - feel fre to open the Issue.

####  Example of custom binding
Let's imagine you have some custom `IndicatorView` that represents some selected indicator
and it has method `setIndicatorPosition` that allows you to set it:
```
class IndicatorView(context: Context) : View(context) {

    fun getIndicatorPosition(): Int {...}

    fun setIndicatorPosition(position: Int) {...}
}
```
And you want to add binding support to this value.  
First of all, you have to decide, which Property should you use for binding.  
As this View works with Int as position, you'd better choose `Property<Int>`.

After that, implementation will differ depends on which module do you prefer to use - `binds` or `bindsx`  
`binds`-like way:
```
fun IndicatorView.bindIndicatorPosition(property: Property<Int>) =
    property.subscribe(::setIndicatorPosition)
```
And actually that's all!  
Just Two lines of code (or even one) and you can use this binding as well as others.

It will look a bit different for `bindsx`-like:
```
fun LifecycleOwner.bindIndicatorPosition(
    indicator: IndicatorView,
    property: Property<Int>,
    bindTo: Lifecycle.Event = ON_DESTROY // add this only if you want to customize time of unsubscribe
) = bind(property, bindTo, indicator::setIndicatorPosition) // or use without bindTo if you don't care
```
A bit more lines of code but still as simple as previous version.

## `livedata` module

This module contains LiveData to Property transformations and vice versa.  
Available transformations:
* Property to LiveData: use `asLiveData()` extension.
* Livedata to Property: use `asProperty()` (will produce nullable Properties) or `asNonNullProperty()` with optional default value.


## How to add to Project:
**Step 1.** Add the JitPack repository to your build file.  
Add this in your module's build.gradle at the end of repositories:  
```
repositories {
    ...
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
}
```
**Step 2.** Add the dependencies
```
implementation "com.github.green-nick.properties-android:binds:{latest version}"
implementation "com.github.green-nick.properties-android:bindsx:{latest version}"
implementation "com.github.green-nick.properties-android:livedata:{latest version}"
```
